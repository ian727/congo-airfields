# Inkisi Airport (FZAS)

**Location:** Kisantu, Kongo Central  
**Status:** Possibly Removed  
**ICAO Code:** FZAS  
**Coordinates (not verified):** -5.162953°, 15.002718°  

Kisantu is a historical town in Kongo Central province, located along the Matadi-Kinshasa railway and National Road 1 (RN1). The name "Inkisi" originates from the Inkisi River, which crosses the railway at Kisantu. Over time, the river’s name began to be used synonymously with the town, leading to maps labeling the settlement as either "Inkisi" or "Kisantu," and sometimes marking both names separately.

Kisantu has grown into a regional center with over 75,000 inhabitants and is home to a cathedral and a renowned botanical garden. The town benefits from exceptional accessibility by Congolese standards due to its paved road connection between Kinshasa and Matadi, as well as its railway station, though train services remain infrequent.

## Historical Background

No official documents regarding the establishment of Inkisi Airport have been found. The airport only appears in official databases under the ICAO code FZAS, without further details. It is notable that the airport is referred to as "Inkisi" - a name historically associated with the river rather than the town itself.

The provided ICAO coordinates (-5.167, 15.000) are very generic and appear incorrect, as they point to a location directly on National Road 1. However, the 1967 version of the aeronautical Joint Operations Graphics by the U.S. Defense Mapping Agency marks an airfield in the same general area, referred to as "KM 237 Airport." This name likely originates from the airport’s position at kilometer 237 along either the national road or the railway.

Due to the close proximity of the ICAO-listed coordinates and the KM 237 Airport location, it can be reasonably assumed that they refer to the same facility.

## Current Status

Matching the KM 237 Airport location with satellite imagery does not provide clear evidence of an airstrip. The approximate location, about 300 meters north of National Road 1, appears realistic, but there are no distinct remnants of a runway visible.

Some patterns in the satellite imagery hint at past infrastructure, but no conclusive signs of a runway remain. While it is likely that Inkisi Airport once existed at or near -5.162953°, 15.002718°, it seems that all physical traces have been lost over time.
