    <h1>Welcome to Congo Airfields</h1>

    <p>The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is a vast country with a history as complex as its geography. Once a colony of Belgium, the country was heavily exploited for its natural resources, leading to widespread human rights violations. The **borders of modern Congo are colonial constructs**, encompassing a nation **X times** the size of Belgium.</p>

    <p>However, large-scale resource extraction required a **functioning transportation network**. This included **hundreds of small airfields**, many of which were already present in colonial times. Following independence in 1960, decades of political struggles, authoritarian rule under Mobutu, and **the deterioration of road infrastructure** made these airfields even more crucial for transport.</p>

    <h2>Airfields in the Congo</h2>

    <p>Unlike in many other countries, **there is no single, official database documenting small airfields in the DRC**. Some airports received ICAO codes before independence, using an early **"FCXX"** format (with "FC" for "Congo Belge"). When the country was renamed Zaire in 1971 (verify), the **first two ICAO letters changed to "FZ"**, a structure that persists to this day.</p>

    <p>The **last two ICAO code letters do not correspond to city names** (as in many other countries) but instead follow a **regional alphabetical system**. The regions were divided so that the codes **move clockwise across the country**, starting with "A" for Kongo Central, "B," "C," and "D" for the former Bandundu region, "E" for Equateur, and continuing in this pattern until "W" for inland airports like Lodja and Mbuji-Mayi. A full **map of these ICAO letter zones** will be added to this website.</p>

    <p>However, **not all airstrips received an ICAO code**, and even for larger airstrips, the system for allocating codes remains unclear. Some **significant airstrips lack official documentation**, while others still appear in databases despite being **abandoned or lost to redevelopment**. Locating some of these airports requires **detective work**, analyzing **old satellite imagery, historical maps, and archives**.</p>

    <h2>About This Website</h2>

    <p>I have spent **countless hours** researching Congolese airstrips as a hobby, gathering **every bit of information available**. I believe this knowledge should be **publicly accessible**, helping others—whether out of curiosity, for research, or practical needs—to find the same answers I sought.</p>

    <p>In 2018, I was lucky enough to visit the **Democratic Republic of the Congo**, a beautiful country with wonderful people. While there, I saw firsthand the **unique status of many airstrips**. For example, at **Gungu Airport**, I observed a common practice: **airstrips that are not formally maintained but are kept clear. If a flight is announced, local residents cut the vegetation, making the airstrip operational again within hours.**</p>

    <p>This website is, in part, dedicated to the **people of Congo**—to document the infrastructure they rely on and to preserve the history of these airfields before they disappear entirely.</p>
