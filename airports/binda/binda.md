## Binda Airport  

**Location:** Binda, Kongo Central  
**Status:** Abandoned, exact location unknown  
**ICAO Code:** None  
**IATA Code:** None  
**Coordinates (unverified):** Near -5.855178°, 13.218556°  

Binda is a small village situated on the northern shore of the Congo River, between Boma and Matadi. This part of the river is characterized by steep mountains and rugged hills, making inland access extremely difficult. Due to this challenging terrain, Binda appears to lack any road connection to the interior, meaning it can only be reached by boat or on foot.  

The earliest known reference to Binda appears in an 1818 book describing an 1816 expedition to the Congo River. This account describes Binda as being *"situated at some distance inland, high upon the platform of a mountain"* — a description that contrasts with its current location directly along the river’s shore.  

Today, Binda remains a tiny village, with fewer than 40 small houses. Given its isolation and lack of infrastructure, the purpose of an airfield at Binda remains entirely unclear.  

## Historical Background  

The only known source depicting an airfield at Binda is the 1947 Carte des Renseignements Aéronautiques. Unfortunately, the 1953 Belgian Congo map series, which could have provided additional confirmation, is not available online for this area.

All later maps and aeronautical charts, including those from the 1960s, do not depict an airfield at Binda, raising further questions about its actual existence and operational history.  

## Current Status (as of 2025)  

Information regarding Binda Airport is extremely limited, with only one historical map ever showing an airfield at this location.  

Due to the steep terrain, a runway at Binda could have only been located in two possible places:  
1. Directly along the river’s shore, where limited flat land is available.  
2. On a high plateau above the village, as suggested by the 1818 expedition account.  

Satellite imagery reveals a linear-shaped formation at -5.850178°, 13.215542°, which appears somewhat distinct from the surrounding landscape. However, there is no definitive evidence linking this formation to a former airfield.  

Binda Airport was likely abandoned long ago, possibly even before Congolese independence in 1960. No visible traces remain today, and its exact location and purpose remain a mystery.
