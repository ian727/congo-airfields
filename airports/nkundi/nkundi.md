## Nkundi Airport  

**Location:** Nkundi or Kundi, Kongo Central  
**Status:** Abandoned  
**ICAO Code:** None  
**IATA Code:** None  
**Coordinates:** -4.748582°, 13.816710°  

Nkundi, also known as Kundi, is a village in Kongo Central that serves as a parish of the Communauté Évangélique du Congo. The village is home to a small health center and is located on the eastern edge of a large plantation.  

Information about the plantation's activities is limited, but satellite imagery suggests that industrial-scale cultivation only began after 2014.

## Historical Background  

No documented information exists regarding the establishment of Nkundi Airport. The only known reference to the airfield appears in the 2015 MAF Airports Directory, which provides exact coordinates but does not list an operator.  

However, remarks in the MAF data about the runway's surface quality suggest that the airfield may have seen some degree of MAF service in the past, linking it to missionary activities.   

## Current Status (as of 2025)  

At some point after 2014, a large-scale agricultural project was launched in Nkundi, completely surrounding the airfield.  

Older satellite imagery from 2012 and 2014 shows Nkundi Airport in a barely visible state, indicating that it was already experiencing infrequent use at the time.  

By 2021, the airport's area remained clear due to the plantation development. However, ironically, vegetation growth on the airstrip is more extensive than on the surrounding cultivated land, suggesting that Nkundi Airport has been abandoned for several years.  

Despite its abandoned state, the airport area has not been repurposed or built over. This means that, in theory, Nkundi Airport could be restored with proper maintenance, though more extensive efforts would be required to clear the overgrowth and make the runway operational again.
