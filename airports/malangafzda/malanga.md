## Malanga Airport (FZDA)

**Location:** Malanga, Kongo Central  
**Status:** Intermittent  
**ICAO Code:** FZDA  
**IATA Code:** None  
**Coordinates:** -5.544917°, 14.358120°  

Very little information is available about Malanga’s history. It is a small village located at the intersection of the Matadi-Kinshasa railway with Provincial Road 111, which leads north to Luozi. This strategic location likely explains why the new alignment of the Matadi-Kinshasa railway, built in the 1920s, included a station at Malanga.  

Despite its position along key transport routes, Malanga has experienced minimal growth and remains a small rural settlement. In 2014, construction began on a new cement plant, Cimenterie de Zamba, located 4 kilometers north of Malanga. However, this development is recent and unrelated to the airfield's existence.  

## Historical Background  

Little is known about the history of Malanga Airport (FZDA). A 1953 map of the region does not yet show an airfield, suggesting that it was constructed sometime afterward. The first known depiction of Malanga Airport appears in the 1967 Joint Operations Graphics, published by the U.S. Defense Mapping Agency. The airfield was also still marked on the 1996 U.S. Tactical Pilotage Chart, confirming that it remained in existence at least until that time.

However, the exact purpose of Malanga Airport remains unclear. It is not located near any major settlement or industrial facility, making its original function difficult to determine. Since the Cimenterie de Zamba was only built in 2014, it is not connected to the airfield.  

Adding to the confusion, official aviation datasets contain incorrect coordinates for Malanga Airport. Both MAF and UN data place the airfield 1.5 kilometers northwest of its actual location, leading to further uncertainty about its historical role.  

## Current Status (as of 2025)  

High-resolution satellite imagery from 2013, 2018, and 2022 shows Malanga Airport in an abandoned state. The area is overgrown with vegetation, and only faint traces of the former runway remain visible.  

Despite this, the former airport site has not been redeveloped and remains clear of agricultural activity. Given its intact layout and lack of encroachment, Malanga Airport could likely be restored to operational status with minimal maintenance if needed.
