## Muanda Airport (FZAG)

**Location:** Muanda (Moanda), Kongo Central  
**Status:** Active with regular flights  
**ICAO Code:** FZAG  
**IATA Code:** MNB  
**Coordinates:** -5.930608°, 12.351373°  

Muanda, also spelled Moanda, is the westernmost city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the country’s only coastal city on the Atlantic Ocean. Historically, the main settlement in this region was Banana, a small port town located just south of Muanda. However, Muanda, originally established as a catholic mission in 1889, gradually grew into a large town with schools, a hospital, and hotels.

The city is relatively well-connected to Kinshasa with the National Road 1 (RN1), which is mostly paved. Muanda is home to significant economic activity, primarily due to its offshore oil reserves. The Muanda Oil Terminal, located just off the coast, plays a crucial role in the region’s economy. Additionally, Muanda has some tourism potential, with long Atlantic beaches and its proximity to the Mangroves National Park — one of the few protected coastal ecosystems in Central Africa.

## Historical Background

Little is known about the exact founding date of Muanda Airport (FZAG). However, the 1967 edition of the U.S. Defense Mapping Agency’s aeronautical Joint Operations Graphics clearly marks the airport at its current location. Interestingly, at that time, Muanda was still primarily a mission settlement, with only a handful of houses.

It is likely that Muanda Airport was originally built to serve the mission and the few administrative functions present at the time. However, at some point, the airport underwent significant upgrades, as its runway was paved — a rare feature among regional airports in the DRC.

The most plausible reason for this upgrade was the discovery and exploitation of offshore oil reserves. As oil operations increased, a better transport connection was required, leading to the paving of the runway to accommodate more reliable and frequent flights.

## Current Status (as of 2025)

Muanda Airport remains active, with regular flights connecting it to the rest of the country. However, its role in passenger transportation has fluctuated.

In 2015, the newly established Congo Airways announced regular flights to Muanda, using Dash-8-400 aircraft. However, it remains unclear whether these flights ever took place or were canceled before operations began.

Currently, no scheduled airline service operates at Muanda Airport. However, using Flightradar24, a Beech 1900 aircraft can be observed flying between [Kinshasa N'Djili](../ndjilifzaa/ndjili.md) and Muanda almost daily. These flights are likely charter operations for employees working in the oil industry, rather than publicly available commercial flights.
