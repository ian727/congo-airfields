## Kinkenge Airport  

**Location:** Kinkenge, Kongo Central  
**Status:** Intermittent  
**ICAO Code:** None  
**IATA Code:** None  
**Coordinates:** -4.964161°, 13.649834°  

Kinkenge is a village in Kongo Central province, situated approximately 10 kilometers south of National Road 12, between Tshela and Luozi. It was founded in 1897 as a mission post by the Svenska Missionsförbundet and played an important role during the colonial era. While historical documents mention its early significance, little information is available about its development following Congolese independence in 1960.  

Despite the lack of detailed records, Kinkenge has maintained some regional importance. The village features a small health center, and missionary activities are likely still ongoing. Recent satellite imagery shows several slightly larger buildings, which may correspond to schools, health centers, or religious institutions.  

## Historical Background  

No documented information is available regarding the establishment of Kinkenge Airport. However, low-resolution satellite imagery from 1984 confirms that a runway was already in place at that time, indicating that the airfield had been constructed earlier.  

Interestingly, Kinkenge Airport does not appear on any known aeronautical charts, whether historical or recent. This suggests that it is a private-use airstrip, likely serving local missionary or medical activities rather than commercial or government aviation.  

## Current Status (as of 2025)  

The 2015 MAF Airports Directory includes Kinkenge Airport and provides precise coordinates. The directory lists its operator as "CEZ", which likely refers to the Communauté Évangélique du Zaïre, further supporting the theory that the airfield was linked to missionary work.  

A notable detail from the MAF directory is a warning about a footpath crossing the middle of the runway, suggesting that the airfield is not in continuous use and is instead integrated into daily village life.  

The only available high-resolution satellite imagery, taken in 2014, shows that the airfield originally had a runway of approximately 700 meters in length. By 2014, only about 520 meters appeared to be maintained, with the remaining section overgrown. The footpath mentioned in the MAF directory is clearly visible, reinforcing the idea that the airport is not a regularly used facility.  

Given these observations, Kinkenge Airport is classified as "intermittent," meaning that it receives infrequent maintenance and is likely only made operational when flights are required.
