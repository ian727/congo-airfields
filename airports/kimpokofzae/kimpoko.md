## Kimpoko Airport (FZAE)

**Location:** Kimpoko, Kinshasa
**Status:** Redeveloped  
**ICAO Code:** FZAE  
**IATA Code:** none  
**Coordinates (verified):** -4.214337, 15.558997 

Kimpoko was once a small village located approximately 30 kilometers northeast of Kinshasa. Positioned between [N'Djili International Airport](../ndjilifzaa/ndjili.md) and [Maluku Airport](../malukufzac/maluku.md), the area remained largely undeveloped until the mid-1960s.

During this period, President Mobutu Sese Seko selected a location just south of Kimpoko for an ambitious and highly prestigious political retreat and luxury resort. This area was named N’Sele, although its proximity to Kimpoko also led to it being commonly referred to as Kimpoko-N’Sele.

The development of N’Sele included monumental construction projects, featuring a presidential palace, extensive accommodations, monuments, swimming pools, and a botanical garden. The area became the headquarters of the MPR (Mouvement Populaire de la Révolution), Mobutu’s single-party system that ruled Zaire until the 1990s. In 1967, the "Manifeste de la N’Sele" was drafted here, laying out the ideological foundation of the MPR.

Throughout Mobutu’s rule, N’Sele remained a blend of political seminar venue and luxurious resort, frequented by political elites and foreign dignitaries. However, the retreat's fate changed dramatically in the early 1990s when Kinshasa faced political unrest and riots. During the subsequent Congo Wars, N’Sele was extensively looted and destroyed, leaving it in ruins. In the years that followed, the once-glorious retreat was left abandoned, gradually reclaimed by vegetation.

## Historical Background

Little information exists regarding the establishment of Kimpoko Airport. However, it is officially listed in the ICAO database as FZAE.

The 1966 aeronautical Joint Operations Graphics map, published by the U.S. Defense Mapping Agency, marks the airport’s location near the main road leading to Kimpoko. Given that Kimpoko itself was only a small village at the time, it is likely that the airport was constructed in parallel with the development of the N’Sele resort. Its primary function was probably to fly in government officials, architects, and high-profile guests during the construction of the prestigious retreat.

## Current Status (as of 2025)

By 1996, Kimpoko Airport was no longer depicted on the U.S. Tactical Pilotage Chart, suggesting that it had ceased to exist by then. Satellite imagery of the location indicated on the 1966 map shows that the area was later redeveloped with additional accommodations for the N’Sele resort — likely during the 1970s when the site was still actively in use.

Today, no trace of Kimpoko Airport remains. Its existence appears to have been extremely short-lived, likely only serving as a temporary airstrip during the construction phase of the N’Sele retreat. Once the main facilities were completed, the airport likely became redundant and was built over.

In recent years, the Congolese government has taken actions to restore N'sele and its facilities. Gradually, they have again been established as a tourist destination, but the restoration works are far from complete.
