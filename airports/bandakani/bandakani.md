## Historical Background  

Information about Bandakani Airport is extremely scarce. The only known reference to an airfield at this location appears in a geo-dataset provided by the United Nations (UN). However, neither the 2015 UN DR Congo Aerodromes and Helipads Directory nor the 2015 MAF Airports Directory list an airfield at Bandakani. The original source of the dataset’s information remains unknown, making it unclear whether an airfield ever officially existed here.  

Additionally, no historical or recent aeronautical charts depict an airfield at Bandakani, further contributing to the uncertainty regarding its past existence.  

## Current Status (as of 2025)  

Given the size and significance of Bandakani Mission, it would not be unusual for it to have had a small airfield at some point. Several smaller missions in the region have or previously had airstrips, some of which served MAF flights in the past.  

However, the fact that Bandakani Airport is absent even from the MAF dataset suggests that, if it did exist, it was abandoned a very long time ago. The airfield was likely a small landing strip used primarily to support missionary activities, though there is no official confirmation of its operational history.  

The area surrounding the mission includes several locations suitable for a small airstrip. However, despite a detailed analysis of available satellite imagery, no visible traces of a runway or airfield infrastructure could be identified. As a result, Bandakani Airport remains classified as abandoned, with its exact location unknown.
