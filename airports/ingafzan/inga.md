## Inga Airport (FZAN)

**Location:** Inga, Kongo Central  
**Status:** Active  
**ICAO Code:** FZAN  
**IATA Code:** None  
**Coordinates:** -5.529591°, 13.575741°  

Wikipedia features a [comprehensive article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inga_dams) on the Inga Dams, providing detailed information on their history, current state, and future developments. The following summary is based on that article.

The Inga Dams are a series of hydroelectric facilities located on the Congo River, approximately 220 kilometers southwest of Kinshasa. They harness the immense power of the Inga Falls, where the river drops 96 meters with an average discharge of 42,000 cubic meters per second.  

The first installation, Inga I**, was completed in 1972, with a capacity of 351 megawatts (MW). It was followed by Inga II in 1982, capable of producing up to 1,424 MW. Despite their potential, both dams have faced persistent maintenance issues, aging infrastructure, and unreliable electricity generation. While rehabilitation efforts continue, much of their capacity remains underutilized due to financial and operational challenges.  

Looking forward, the Grand Inga Project envisions an expansion that could generate between 40 and 70 gigawatts (GW), making it the largest hydroelectric power facility in the world. However, progress has been slow, with repeated delays due to funding difficulties, political instability, and logistical hurdles. In early 2025, the Chinese state-owned Three Gorges Corporation withdrew from the initiative, adding further uncertainty to its future.  

## Historical Background  

Inga Airport (FZAN) was constructed sometime between 1965 and 1984, replacing [Inga Airport (old)](ingaold.md). Following the relocation of the airport, the former airfield site was redeveloped to accommodate main operational facilities for the Inga Dams, serving as housing and administrative infrastructure for dam personnel.

By 1996, the U.S. Tactical Pilotage Chart marked Inga Airport (FZAN) at its current location, listing it as the only airport in Inga. This confirmes that the transition from the old airfield to the new one was fully completed by that time.

## Current Status (as of 2025)  

Inga Airport remains maintained, active, and operational. The airfield features a 1,090-meter-long paved runway, along with a small apron and a modest terminal building.

There are no scheduled flights to Inga Airport. Its sole function is to provide rapid access to the hydroelectric facilities at Inga, ensuring logistical support for personnel and operations related to the Inga Dams.
