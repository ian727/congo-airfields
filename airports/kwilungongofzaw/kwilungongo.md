Kwilu-Ngongo is a town in western Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in Kongo Central province. It is best known as the home of the Compagnie sucrière Kwilu-Ngongo, a major sugar-producing company established in 1925.  

More information about the sugar mill’s history and operations can be found on English Wikipedia:  
[Compagnie sucrière Kwilu-Ngongo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compagnie_sucri%C3%A8re_Kwilu-Ngongo).  

## Historical Background  

Kwilu-Ngongo Airport (FZAW) was established sometime between 1953 and 1965, primarily to support crop-dusting operations for the large sugar cane fields managed by the Compagnie sucrière Kwilu-Ngongo.  

The first known depiction of Kwilu-Ngongo Airport appears in the 1967 Joint Operations Graphics, published by the U.S. Defense Mapping Agency. However, the airfield is mislabeled as "Kwilu Congo" on this map. Other online sources also contain alternative spellings, such as "Kwilu Gongo Airport", further adding to the inconsistencies in its documentation.

## Current Status (as of 2025)  

Kwilu-Ngongo Airport (FZAW) remains active, primarily serving crop-dusting aircraft. The airfield features a 1,280-meter-long dirt runway, with runway designation markings clearly visible.  

The airport is also equipped with a large hangar, used for storing aircraft and maintenance operations. Satellite imagery suggests that the airfield is well-maintained and frequently used, likely continuing its agricultural aviation role.
