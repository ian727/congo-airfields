## Boma Airport (old) and Boma Lukandu Airport (new) (FZAJ)

**Location:** Boma, Kongo Central  
**Status:** Operational, though unclear  
**ICAO Code:** FZAJ  
**IATA Code:** BOA  
**Coordinates:**  
- Old airport: -5.856810°, 13.061974°  
- New airport: -5.804751°, 12.996334°  

Boma is one of the oldest cities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with a history stretching back to its foundation by merchants in the 16th century. Due to its strategic location along the Congo River, it became a crucial hub for trade and colonial administration. From 1886 to 1923, Boma served as the capital of the Congo Free State and later the Belgian Congo, making it the political center of the colony. During this time, it was heavily shaped by colonial influences, many of which remain visible in its preserved historical architecture.

Despite losing its capital status to Kinshasa (then Léopoldville) in 1923, Boma remained significant due to its river port. However, when Matadi emerged as the major inland shipping terminal, Boma’s prominence further declined. Today, with a population of nearly 600,000, the city remains a key urban center in Kongo Central. Situated in one of the more stable regions of the country, it has even gained some attention as a tourist destination.

## Historical Background

The origins of Boma’s first airport are not well documented, but it was likely established in the early 20th century during the colonial era, possibly in the 1920s or 1930s. Located just east of the city, the airport was gradually surrounded by urban expansion until it became completely enclosed within Boma’s dense cityscape. The old airport featured an unpaved runway measuring only 1,020 meters in length, which severely limited its capacity to handle larger aircraft.

Due to the airport’s small size and lack of expansion possibilities, a decision was made in 2012 to construct a new airport, named Boma Lukandu International Airport. This new facility was planned to be located 8.5 kilometers northwest of Boma and was designed to feature a modern terminal and a 3,000-meter-long runway. However, construction stalled after just 2,000 meters of the runway were graded, and the project has remained incomplete ever since.

## Current Status (as of 2025)

Since the opening of the new site in 2012, the old Boma Airport has been abandoned. The former runway is now largely overgrown, and new buildings have begun to encroach on the former airport grounds. 

Despite never being fully completed, the new Boma Lukandu Airport has already seen limited use. In 2019, a flight carrying President Félix Tshisekedi landed at the airport, confirming that the runway is capable of handling aircraft. However, the airport’s actual operational status remains uncertain. A [2021 report by ACP](https://acp.cd/economie/kongo-central-aeroport-de-lukandu-a-boma-abandonne-a-son-triste-sort/) described the airport as abandoned, with its access road in poor condition. More recent information is scarce, but 2022 satellite imagery suggests that the airport has not been maintained.

The transfer of the ICAO and IATA codes (FZAJ/BOA) from the old airport to the new one has not been officially confirmed, adding to the uncertainty surrounding the facility’s current status.
