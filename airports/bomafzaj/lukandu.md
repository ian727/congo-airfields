## Boma Lukandu Airport

**Location:** Boma, Kongo Central  
**Status:** Presumed active
**ICAO Code:** none    
**IATA Code:** none    
**Coordinates:** -5.804751°, 12.996334°  

Boma is one of the oldest cities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with a history stretching back to its foundation by merchants in the 16th century. Due to its strategic location along the Congo River, it became a crucial hub for trade and colonial administration. From 1886 to 1923, Boma served as the capital of the Congo Free State and later the Belgian Congo, making it the political center of the colony. During this time, it was heavily shaped by colonial influences, many of which remain visible in its preserved historical architecture.

Despite losing its capital status to Kinshasa (then Léopoldville) in 1923, Boma remained significant due to its river port. However, when Matadi emerged as the major inland shipping terminal, Boma’s prominence further declined. Today, with a population of nearly 600,000, the city remains a key urban center in Kongo Central. Situated in one of the more stable regions of the country, it has even gained some attention as a tourist destination.

## Historical Background

Boma was originally served by [Boma Airport](boma.md) located just east of the town's center. Due to the airport’s small size and lack of expansion possibilities, a decision was made in 2012 to construct a new airport, named **Boma Lukandu International Airport**. This new facility is located 8.5 kilometers northwest of Boma and was originally designed to feature a modern terminal and a 3,000-meter-long runway. However, construction stalled after just 2,000 meters of the runway were graded, and the project has remained incomplete ever since.

## Current Status (as of 2025)

Despite never being fully completed, the new Boma Lukandu Airport has already seen limited use. In 2019, a flight carrying President Félix Tshisekedi landed at the airport, confirming that the runway is capable of handling aircraft. However, the airport’s actual operational status remains uncertain. A [2021 report by ACP](https://acp.cd/economie/kongo-central-aeroport-de-lukandu-a-boma-abandonne-a-son-triste-sort/) describes the airport as abandoned, with its access road in poor condition. More recent information is scarce, but 2022 satellite imagery suggests that the airport has not been maintained.

The transfer of the ICAO and IATA codes (FZAJ/BOA) from the old airport to the new one has not been officially confirmed, adding to the uncertainty surrounding the facility’s current status.
