The history and operational details of N'Dolo Airport are already well-documented and can be easily accessed through various online sources. A great article about N'Dolo Airport can be found [here](https://kosubaawate.blogspot.com/2013/04/1925-ndolo-airport-first-flight-from.html).

This airport is included in this database only for the sake of completeness, as the primary focus of this project is to document lesser-known airfields across the country.
