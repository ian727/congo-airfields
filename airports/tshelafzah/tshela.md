# Tshela Airport (FZAH)

**Location:** Tshela, Kongo Central
**Status:** Abandoned, but reactivation in progress  
**ICAO Code:** FZAH  
**IATA Code:** none  
**Coordinates (verified):** -5.013936°, 12.956319°

Tshela is a town in the western part of Kongo Central province and serves as a regional center located approximately 100 kilometers north of Boma. Due to its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, Kongo Central was one of the most developed provinces during colonial times, benefiting from a dense network of transportation infrastructure. Tshela was once connected to Boma by a railway line, which was dismantled in 1984 under the rule of Mobutu Sese Seko.

## Historical Background

Official information about Tshela Airport is extremely limited. While its ICAO code includes it in official aviation databases, the provided coordinates point to dense jungle mixed with some houses northeast of Tshela. As is the case with many other airfields in the region, the recorded coordinates appear to be incorrect, further supported by old satellite imagery that reveals no trace of an airport at that location.

No documentation has been found regarding the founding of Tshela Airport. The first verifiable appearance of the airfield is on the 1967 version of the aeronautical Joint Operations Graphics by the U.S. Defense Mapping Agency. This map depicts the airfield southwest of Tshela. When matching this location with satellite imagery, a patch of land cleared of vegetation is visible, with faint traces of a former runway alignment.

## Current Status

The area where Tshela Airport once operated is currently used for agricultural purposes, with fields covering much of the site. The condition of the facilities suggests that the airport has been abandoned for many years.

However, an article dated December 21, 2024, from Kongomedia states that a new bridge, "Pont Ngandavio," has been rebuilt. The article further mentions that with this bridge in place, the former location of Tshela Airport is accessible again, implying that its collapse may have been a contributing factor to the airport's abandonment.

The same article also reports that with the new bridge, the RVA (Régie des Voies Aériennes, the Congolese aviation authority) has commenced work on the rehabilitation of Tshela Airport. After years of abandonment, Tshela Airport might soon return to operational status.
