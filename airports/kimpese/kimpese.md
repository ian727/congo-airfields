## Kimpese Airport  

**Location:** Kimpese, Kongo Central  
**Status:** Abandoned  
**ICAO Code:** none  
**IATA Code:** none  
**Coordinates:** -5.558347°, 14.458567°  

Kimpese is a town situated along National Road 1 and the Matadi-Kinshasa railway, serving as a regional hub with historical ties to missionary and agricultural activities. The earliest mention of Kimpese found online dates back to 1908, when the town’s hospital was founded.  

Due to its strategic location along the railway, Kimpese experienced steady growth, attracting several Christian missions that managed the hospital along with other social and economic initiatives. However, as late as 1980, Kimpese was still referred to as a large village, indicating that its development remained moderate despite its favorable position.  

Today, archival sources suggest that Kimpese continues to be economically active, with a focus on agriculture and local trade.  

## Historical Background  

The origins of Kimpese Airport remain unclear, as no historical maps or aeronautical charts depict an airfield at this location. This absence of documentation makes it difficult to determine when the airstrip was established and suggests that it may have been created unofficially.  

The only known source listing an airfield at Kimpese is the 2015 MAF Airports Directory, which provides exact coordinates and names CEC as the operator. CEC most likely refers to the Communauté Évangélique du Congo, which aligns with the town’s strong missionary presence.  

The MAF listing also warns of obstacles at the site, including a Vodacom tower at the eastern end of the runway and a TV antenna at the western end. This indicates that MAF aircraft operated at Kimpese in relatively recent years.  

Satellite imagery from 2013 clearly shows Kimpese’s dirt runway, but its irregular width and general appearance already suggest that maintenance was minimal. Over the following years, progressive deterioration is evident in later imagery, marking the airfield’s gradual decline.

## Current Status (as of 2025)  

The most recent available satellite imagery of Kimpese Airport, from 2022, confirms that the airfield is completely abandoned. While the property remains undeveloped, with no signs of housing encroachment, the land is now used for agriculture, featuring small crop fields and scattered farming plots.
