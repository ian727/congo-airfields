## Celo-Zongo Airport (FZAD)

**Location:** Zongo, Kongo Central  
**Status:** Intermittent  
**ICAO Code:** FZAD  
**IATA Code:** None  
**Coordinates (verified):** -4.790664°, 14.905632°  

The Zongo Waterfalls are one of the most renowned tourist attractions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Located on the Inkisi River, just 5 kilometers east of its confluence with the Congo River, the waterfalls are a breathtaking natural spectacle. 

Situated 75 kilometers southwest of Kinshasa, Zongo Falls is one of the few accessible tourist destinations in the country. The region has remained relatively stable and unaffected by the conflicts that have plagued much of the Congo, making it a safe and appealing getaway for both locals and international visitors. The road connection to Kinshasa is well-maintained, allowing for relatively smooth travel. 

Since colonial times, Zongo has been known as a travel destination. Today, several tourist agencies offer guided trips, including sightseeing tours and swimming excursions in the falls' refreshing waters. The availability of established lodges and hotels makes Zongo one of the very few places in the DRC where visitors can actually book accommodations in advance.

## Historical Background

Very little official documentation exists regarding the establishment of Celo-Zongo Airport. No precise records were found that indicate when the airstrip was originally built or by whom. 

However, its existence can be confirmed through historical maps. The 1966 edition of the U.S. Defense Mapping Agency's aeronautical Joint Operations Graphics clearly marks the airstrip under the name "Zongo Airport".

By 1996, the U.S. Tactical Pilotage Chart continued to display the airport at the same location under the name Celo-Zongo Airport, confirming that it was still known and used by that time.

The current name, Celo-Zongo Airport, appears to be derived from a nearby village named Celo, which can be found on a 1936 map. Today, Celo appears to be called Selo, with verious sources calling it either Selo-Zongo or Zongo-Selo.

## Current Status (as of 2025)  

The operational status of Celo-Zongo Airport remains unclear. There is no known evidence of recent flights taking place at the airstrip. However, satellite imagery confirms its presence, and it remains a clearly defined area. 

Interestingly, the airport's shape is easily recognizable on aerial images not because of visible infrastructure, but because its perimeter is clearly delineated by roads that curve around it.  

The airport itself appears to be a grassy field, with no visible markings such as tire tracks that would indicate recent aircraft activity. This strongly suggests that no planes have used the airport for a long time.  

However, despite the apparent lack of activity, the runway area is still kept clear of vegetation and potential obstructions. Given the proximity of Zongo's tourist infrastructure, it is possible that the airport is maintained for emergency use, allowing for quick evacuations in case of a medical or security incident at the resort.
