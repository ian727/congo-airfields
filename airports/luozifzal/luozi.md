## Luozi Airport (FZAL)

**Location:** Luozi, Kongo Central  
**Status:** Intermittent  
**ICAO Code:** FZAL  
**IATA Code:** LZI  
**Coordinates:** -4.943525°, 14.123001°  

Luozi is a town in Kongo-Central Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo, located on the northern bank of the Congo River. It has historically served as an important regional trade center, particularly for caravans traveling between the coast and Pool Malebo, exchanging goods such as textiles, agricultural products, and metalware. During the colonial period, Luozi became an administrative hub with government buildings, a hospital, and a large weekly market that attracted traders and fishermen from both sides of the river. By 1957, its population was around 2,200, and the town played a modest but vital role in regional commerce.

In the late 1950s, Luozi experienced political unrest tied to the broader nationalist movements that swept the Congo in the lead-up to independence. Protests and tax resistance led to Belgian military intervention, intensifying local opposition to colonial rule. The town continued to grow in the post-independence era, though political and economic instability under Mobutu Sese Seko's regime left a lasting impact. By 1989, Luozi’s population had expanded significantly, and recent estimates suggest that the wider Luozi territory, encompassing 11 decentralized sectors, has a population exceeding 78,000, with more than 700 villages and thousands of farming households.

Today, Luozi remains a local trade and administrative center, with strong cultural ties to the broader Kongo region. Despite its historical importance, its development has been shaped by transportation limitations and shifting economic dynamics. The town also retains a rich tradition of local knowledge, particularly in the use of spontaneous flora for food, with residents relying on a diverse range of plants for nutrition and sustenance.

## Historical Background

The origins of Luozi Airport date back to 1927, when the Compagnie Belge du Commerce established a station in the town. Shortly afterward, plans were made to construct an airstrip to facilitate travel and trade. The first recorded landing at Luozi Airport took place in 1928, marking the beginning of aviation activity in the region.

By 1947, the airfield was officially marked as an "Aérodrome du Secours" (Minor Airfield) on the Carte des Renseignements Aéronautiques, indicating its strategic role in aviation at the time. The 1966 aeronautical Joint Operations Graphics map, published by the U.S. Defense Mapping Agency, confirms that Luozi Airport was located at the same position it occupies today.

## Current Status (as of 2025)

Luozi Airport continues to exist but is used only intermittently. The 2015 MAF Airports Directory provides more detailed information about the airfield, indicating that it is occasionally utilized by MAF flights. The directory includes a note stating:  
*"Numerous paths. Crowd control needed. Animals!"*  

This assessment aligns with satellite imagery, which shows that while the runway is still present, it is entirely surrounded by urban development, with numerous footpaths crossing the airfield. No signs of active maintenance are visible, suggesting that the airport is not regularly operational. However, given that the airstrip remains intact, it could be put back into use if required — for example, if a MAF flight is scheduled.  

For this reason, the airport’s status has been designated as "intermittent", meaning it is not actively maintained but remains functional for occasional operations.
