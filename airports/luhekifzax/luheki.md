Available information about Luheki is extremely limited. The name Luheki is likely an alternative spelling of Lueki, but this does not provide much clarity, as Lueki can refer to multiple unrelated things.  

- Lueki is the name of a triassic-age geological formation within the Congo Basin.  
- It is also the name of a manioc variety cultivated in the Kongo Central region.  
- Most relevantly, Lueki is the name of a river in the vicinity of the given coordinates for Luheki Airport, which is the most likely origin of the airfield’s name.  

Some historical documents mention Lueki in connection with agricultural projects, but it remains unclear whether they refer to the Lueki River in Kongo Central.  

Despite an extensive analysis of satellite imagery, no visible traces of a large plantation, factory, or significant infrastructure were found along the Luheki/Lueki River, leaving the airport’s origins uncertain.  

## Historical Background  

The only known reference to Luheki Airport (FZAX) is its entry in the official ICAO database, which provides its name and an inaccurate set of coordinates. No additional historical data or mapping records of the airfield could be found.  

The 2015 MAF Airports Directory includes an entry for Luheki, but only repeats the incorrect coordinates without providing any additional details. No operator is listed, and the only technical information available is that the airport’s runway designations were 10/28.  

## Current Status (as of 2025)  

Despite extensive research, the exact location of Luheki Airport (FZAX) remains unknown, and its former purpose could not be established. It most likely existed somewhere near the given inaccurate coordinates, but no evidence of an airfield, agricultural infrastructure, or industrial site is visible in the wider region.  

The location of Luheki Airport (FZAX) remains a mystery.
