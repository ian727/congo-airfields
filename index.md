# Background

The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is a vast country with a history as complex as its geography. Once a colony of Belgium, the country was heavily exploited for its natural resources, leading to widespread human rights violations. The borders of modern Congo are colonial constructs, encompassing a nation almost 77 times the size of Belgium.

However, large-scale resource extraction required a functioning transportation network. This included hundreds of small airfields, many of which were already present in colonial times. Following independence in 1960, decades of political struggles, authoritarian rule under Mobutu, and the deterioration of road infrastructure made these airfields even more crucial for transport.

## Airfields in the Congo

Unlike in many other countries, there is no single, official database documenting small airfields in the DRC. Some airports received ICAO codes before independence, using an early **"FCXX"** format (with "FC" for "Congo Belge"). When the country was renamed Zaire in 1971, the first two ICAO letters changed to **"FZ"**, a structure that persists to this day.

The last two ICAO code letters do not correspond to city names (as in many other countries) but instead follow a regional alphabetical system. The regions were divided so that the codes move clockwise across the country, starting with "A" for Kongo Central, "B," "C," and "D" for the former Bandundu region, "E" for Equateur, and continuing in this pattern until "W" for inland airports like Lodja and Mbuji-Mayi. A full map of these ICAO letter zones will be added to this website.

## About This Website

I have spent countless hours researching Congolese airstrips as a hobby, gathering every bit of information available. I believe this knowledge should be publicly accessible, helping others — whether out of curiosity, for research, or practical needs — to find the same answers I sought.

In 2018, I was lucky enough to visit the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a beautiful country with wonderful people. While there, I saw firsthand the unique status of many airstrips. For example, at Gungu Airport, I observed a common practice: airstrips that are not formally maintained but are kept clear. If a flight is announced, local residents cut the vegetation, making the airstrip operational again within hours.

This website is, in part, dedicated to the people of Congo — to document the infrastructure they rely on and to preserve the history of these airfields before they disappear entirely.
