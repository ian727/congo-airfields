## About the Author

My name is Ian Pasternak, and I was born and raised in Berlin, Germany. I have been fascinated by Central Africa for a long time — a region that originally caught my attention for the same reason that led me to create this website: the significant lack of documentation on many aspects of its geography, history, and infrastructure.

I have always been naturally curious, and when I can’t find answers to things I’m looking for, I tend to start researching. My particular passion lies in old infrastructure. In Europe, I have spent a lot of time using historical maps to document abandoned railways, and I have visited many of their remains during my cycling tours. I also enjoy exploring old, abandoned buildings and metal detecting, trying to uncover things from the past.

In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the situation is quite different. Much of its infrastructure is poorly documented, and yet, paradoxically, there are official lists that suggest a certain degree of organization. For example, the country has a detailed multi-level network of national roads, and 286 airports with official ICAO codes.

However, a closer examination reveals a different reality. Many of the officially numbered roads are in extremely bad condition — some have even ceased to exist. A striking example is National Road 1 east of Kikwit, which was realigned in the mid-1980s. This new alignment was never updated in official documentation, meaning that the old sections (for example Kikwit - Idiofa), which are still in use, remain without any reference number to this day.

The same problem applies to airports — as described on the main page, the existence, condition, and location of several airstrips are highly questionable despite being officially listed.

## About the Research

Researching old infrastructure in the DRC is challenging and often requires a combination of different methods. When investigating airports, I primarily rely on historical maps, particularly old aeronautical charts.

One invaluable source of information used to be the Royal Museum for Central Africa in Tervuren, Belgium, which houses a huge collection of colonial-era maps. Unfortunately, these maps are no longer accessible online, taking away one of my main sources for information.

Another essential tool in my research is satellite imagery, which has been available since 1984, albeit at very low resolution. Despite this limitation, maintained dirt runways in forested areas can often be clearly distinguished. With more recent high-resolution imagery, I scan the surroundings of suspected old airstrips, looking for faint traces of former runway alignments.

Of course, the best source of information would be local knowledge. However, my network of contacts in the Congo is limited, and establishing new connections solely for a hobby project like this is not easy.

Due to the difficult nature of this research, many of my findings involve theories and speculation — particularly when attempting to locate missing airports or explain anomalies in ICAO documentation. However, I am committed to ensuring that all unverified information is clearly marked on this website.

The collection of information and all conclusions made on this website are the courtesy of humans. However, in some instances, information is collected in or compiled to bullet points, which are transformed into flowing text with the help of AI. All respective text is read, checked and verified by humans. Furthermore, AI is used to help with the translation of English content to French.

## Contact

I would love to collaborate! If you have any information about an airfield in the DRC, or if you share an interest in documenting abandoned infrastructure, feel free to get in touch.
